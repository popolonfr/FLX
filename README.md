# FLX
This is a variant of [**FL.COM V133**](https://github.com/gdx-msx/FL) (Version of [**GDX**](https://github.com/gdx-msx)) for MSX that is used to load a Rom file. It takes over all the functions with the support of the [**16 Mega Flash ROM SCC cartridge**](https://www.msx.org/wiki/Popolon-fr_Flash-ROM_SCC_Cartridge) with faster formatting and loading of large files. Under DOS, type "FLX filename.ROM" then press the Return key. "FLX /e" to erase the contents of the Flash Rom.
