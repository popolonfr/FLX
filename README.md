# FLX
This is a variant of [**FL.COM**](https://github.com/gdx-msx/FL) for MSX that is used to load a Rom file. It takes over all the functions with the support of the 16 Mega FlashRom cartridge with faster formatting and loading of large files. Under DOS, type "FLX filename.ROM" then press the Return key. "FLX /e" to erase the contents of the Flash Rom.
